# InverseCaseMicroProject
This is my MicroProject 1 in CSC 344.

Write a C program which contains the following: a function called invert_case, taking a string pointer argument, which inverts the case of each letter in the provided string; a main function which asks the user for an input string, calls invert_case using a pointer to that string, and prints the output.
